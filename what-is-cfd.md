# What is CFD?

Before we delve into the details, we need to agree on a definition:
> CFD is the study of  fluid flow through numerical methods via computers.

Almost all types of contemporary fluid flow solutions fall within the definition above and can be formally thought of as CFD. This includes potential flow methods. However, since CFD evolved much later than potential flow, when we talk about CFD we typically refer to the Navier-Stokes equations. The image below shows the relationship between the different types of flow, starting from linear, inviscid, irrotational flow, all the way up to Direct Numerical Simulations (DES) where virtually no assumptions are made about the flow. This course will mostly focus at the level of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes and items below.
