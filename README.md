You may use the menu on the left to jump to a section containing topics that interest you, but I recommend you work through the the material in the suggested sequence. The order of the material is designed to give you a high-level overview of CFD, beginning from conservation of mass and momentum to more advanced topics as well as practical items, such as techniques to set up numerical simulations and writing your own code. 

I welcome comments and suggestions, which you can send through the [Feedback page](feedback).

## Site Setup

### Static Webserver
Upload these template files to any static web server. The file `.nojekyll` is only required if hosting the site on GitHub Pages and otherwise can be removed.

### GitHub Pages

#### Hosting Site

To host this template on GitHub Pages do the following:  

1. Log into GitHub if you have not done so already
2. Tap the **Use this template** button in the upper-right of this GitHub Repository and choose **Create a new repository**
3. Enter a name for your new Repository and then tap the **Create repository** button
4. Once your new Repostitory is created go to **Settings**, then select **Pages** from the left-hand sidebar, and under **Branch** choose **main** and then tap the **Save** button
5. Wait a minute or two and refresh the same **Pages** page - once your site is ready a message will be displayed at the top of the screen along with a site link and a **Visit site** button

#### Editing Content

How about editing the content of your new Docsify site on GitHub Pages? View the Markdown page you want to edit (for example, **README.md**) and tap the **Pencil Icon**, then save any changes by tapping the green **Commit changes...** button. In just a few moments the Docsify site will be automatically updated to reflect those changes.



### Viewing Locally 
Run `npx serve .` (Node.js users) or `python -m http.server 8000` (Python users) in the repo folder to serve run locally.
